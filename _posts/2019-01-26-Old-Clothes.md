### About
One of the national dishes of Cuba, old clothes is a slow cooked beef flank in tomato sauce with spices.
We (Ivy) cooks ours for several hours in an electric slow cooker, which causes the connective tissue to break down and
turn into a rich and delicious sauce with diverse and tasty applications.

If you struggle to find a butcher that sells beef flank, a beef brisket is a good alternative; What you're looking for
is a cut of beef with lots of connective tissue that'll break down with extended cooking times.
If you do substitute with a brisket, liberally trim excess fat, as the cut tends to be substantially fatter.

In either case, dense fat near the skin should be trimmed as it doesn't tend to cook out as well.
