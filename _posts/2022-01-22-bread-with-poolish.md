I like making bread.  It's weirdly interesting that a shaggy sticky mess
eventually turns into a well behaved blob of dough.  It's also alive
on the inside, which is more than can be said for myself.

The following is as much of a recipe as it is a schedule.  The aim is for
the labour-intensive portions to be done outside of business hours and
it can be baked on Monday morning if you're part of the work-from-home
cohort like myself.

The recipe here was adapted from [Flour Water Salt Yeast](https://www.dymocks.com.au/book/flour-water-salt-yeast-by-ken-forkish-and-alan-weiner-9781607742739) which
is 50% the story of a successful bakery and 50% how to make bread better.


## Ingredients

(Makes 4x Loaves.  I'd suggest not going below half if you want to scale it back.)

### For the Poolish

- 800g Bread Flour (just anything high protein.  Or not -- you do you!)
- 200g Whole grain bread flour
- 0.8g instant dried yeast.  (quarter teaspoon if your scales aren't good for small weights)
- 1000g Water.

### For the Bread

- 1000g Poolish (made ahead of time)
- 800g Bread Flour
- 200g Whole Grain Flour
- 500g Water
- 1g dried yeast
- 42g Salt


## Specialised Equipment
- Dutch Oven
- Proofing basket (substitute a medium mixing bowl if unavailable)


## Recipe/Schedule (Total time ~25h)

_ Making the Poolish _

1. Mix the poolish ingrediants until thoroughly combined and leave at room temperature
for ~=24h.  Ready when approximately tripled in volume with lots of bubbles throughout.

_ Mixing the bread and bulk ferment _

2. To the poolish add all of the bread ingredients.  I like to add the water first,
building the flour on top and then mix in the salt before adding the yeast.

3. Mix with your hands - try to alternate between grabbing the poolish at one edge and
folding it over the mixture and squeezing dough through your fingers to help it combine.  Mix it thoroughly until the mixture is even and probably very sticky.

4. Let rest for 15 minutes covered

5. At 15 minute intervals, fold the dough 3-4 times to build gluten.

6. Let rest for approximately an hour for a total bulk ferment time of 2 hours.  Dough
should be 2.5-3x original size after mixing

_ Forming the Loaves _

6. Gently dumb the mixture on a lightly floured counter top and divide into 4 even
portions.

7. Form the loaves (4x) on the counter top.  (See notes for a description)

8. Flour the top surface and then place the loaf with the side you just floured facing
downwards into the proofing basket

9. Flour the exposed surface and refrigerate for ~12 hours.

_ Baking _

10. at least 40 minutes prior to baking, put a dutch oven inside a regular oven
at 245 Celsius.

11. Place the dough inside the dutch oven and do your best not to burn yourself.  (It's _really_ easy to hurt yourself!)

12. Bake Covered for 30 minutes, then for a further 20 minutes.  You can leave the bread in the oven longer if you'd like a darker crust.

13. Extract the bread and place on to a cooling rack, at least 20 minutes before you slice
the bread open.

14. Allow ~5 minutes with the dutch oven back in the regular oven for it to reheat and
then repeat with loaves 2 through 4.

15. Store in a Zip Lock bag.  The bags can be re-used for next weeks bread if you're
organized enough.

### Sample Schedule:

**Day 1**
- **9am** Mix poolish
- **9pm** Begin mixing the bread + bulk ferment
- **11pm** Form loaves, and proof in the fridge overnight

**Day 2**
- **8am** Heat Oven
- **8:40** First Loaf
- **9:40** Second Loaf
- **10:40** Third Loaf
- **11:40** Fourth Loaf
- **12:40** Oven off.  Enjoy bread for the entire week


## Notes

- I've tried using stand mixers to make it easier, but it never really works
any better than by hand, and there's more to clean up afterwards.
- An enormous vessel to do the bulk ferment is ðŸ’¯
- 'Folding' is this thing you do to build structure in the dough.  You kinda pull
a portion of dough up, and then lift it over itself.  Kind of like folding doona
in half.  It builds the gluten matrix which is why the dough eventually keeps an even shape
- Low range scales are awesome
- For whatever reason every time I make bread it sticks irreversibly to whatever
I'm baking it on.  Baking paper or a baking stone is a good idea if _not_ using a Dutch
Oven.
- If baking in a colder climate, make sure the poolish as well as the bread dough
are made using tepid water.  Poolish will be best if started with the mixture at 21-24 degress Celsius.  Adding warmer water is a good idea during winter.
- Forming the loaves is kinda tricky to describe, but I'll try do do so here.
  - With the dough on a work surface, place your hands with your fingertips meeting, pinky
  fingers touching the work surface, and drag them towards you like you're going to give the dough a weird hug.
  - Pull the dough towards you slightly, ensuring your fingers make contact with the dough
  at the base where it meets the counter top
  - Only pull the dough towards you slightly -- It'll mostly stick to the surface, but you should be able to move the back edge towards you a few centermeters.  The edge closest to you should kind of roll over on itself.
  - Do a similar motion to spin the dough on the counter top by 30-45 degrees, then repeat the weird hug from earlier.
  - Repeat until the top becomes taut.  If you do it too much the surface will break and the dough will become unmanageable.
