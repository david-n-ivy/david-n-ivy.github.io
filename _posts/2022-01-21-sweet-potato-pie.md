Australians freak out when you tell them you're bringing your home-made sweet potato pie to the party.  Because it's not in chip form they don't understand the use
of sweet potato in something sweet.  But since it's sweet potato, grammatically it
makes pretty good sense.  Tastes like Christmas, actually.
My recipe for the filling is based from
[this BBC good food article](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/user/718060/recipe/sweet-potato-pie) and the
crust from whoever [Baker Bettie](https://bakerbettie.com/shortbread-crust-sable-breton/) is.

The only notable modifications are to roast the sweet potato until the sugars ooze and always use
cream over milk.

## Ingredients

### For the Crust

- 500g roasted sweet potato
- 125g Butter
- 120mL Cream
- 2 Eggs
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon allspice


### For the Filling

- 170g unsalted butter
- 100g sugar
- 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
- large pinch of salt
- 200g All purpose flour


## Method

### The Filling

Note: The filling can be made a day ahead of time

1. Roast the sweet potato skin on, wrapped in tinfoil in an oven at ~200 Celsius.
It's ready when sugars start to ooze from the outside.  Set aside until chilled.

2. Mix potato and butter until it forms a smooth mash.

3. Add in sugar, cream eggs and spices. and mix until the mixture is consistent.
(Note: When I make this it's usually not homogenous and little blobs of butter and other
ingredients are present.  They melt and combine in the oven well enough for it to not matter)

### The Crust

1. With a paddle mixer, combine all the ingredients at once.  The mixture should be crumbly,
or resemble wet sand.

2. Add the filling to a pie dish and smush it all together.  You can add it directly, or after
chilling it and rolling it out on a floured work surface

### Bringing it Together

After lining a pie dish with the crust and trying your best to get the thickness even, pour filling
into the thing.  Bake at 180 Celsius for 50-60 minutes.  Knife in the middle will come out cleanly
if you did it right.  Leaving it in the oven longer can result in a nice caramelized crust but also
burn it.

## Additional Notes

- Room Temperature butter works best
- Refrigerate the assembled pie crust before baking as the crust is so buttery it can shrink from the sides and cause filling
to spill over the sides
- a two piece pie baking thing is awesome (a flat dish that lifts out from the sides)
- Serve right side up if you're able.  A friend of ours decided to serve our hard work upside down! ðŸ™ƒ
- You can optionally refrigerate the pie crust and then roll it out (it'll help prevent slipping)
- Consume in secret with strong black coffee to avoid judgement from Ivy
