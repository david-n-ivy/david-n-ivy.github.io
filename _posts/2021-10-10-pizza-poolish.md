    When the dough is properly proofed, you'll often see small bubbles at the surface
    of the dough balls.

    sweet and have much more visible activity in the form of bubbles.

    It's better to have a single large container to proof the dough balls in. I don't
    have one so instead I use a set of small food containers, and spray canola oil at the
    bottom so that the dough is easily removed.

    Formation of dough balls.  If you lack talent to shape them like mozarella in your hands as I do,
    a simple way to form the balls is to place the dough balls on a counter top and cup your
    hands around the edge furtest from you and tuck gently, turning and repeating several times.
    The doughs tendancy to stick to the bench top natually helps form nice taut balls.  Don't overdo it!

My current preferred pizza dough.  Adapted 
[My Pizza Corner](https://mypizzacorner.com/pizza-dough/easy-poolish-pizza-dough-recipe-neapolitan-poolish-pizza/)
with slight modifications to proportions.  The only real change is to the hydration.  The recipe isn't terribly
difficult, but I find it very hard to correctly time out the final rise to match when I'm hungry, and also
have an oven ready.  If I end up making myself wait, it's usually worth it.

The dough is made in two stages.  There's an initial Poolish that's made ahead of time that acts to
build flavour and provide yeast.  Poolish is used as a starter to the four water and salt that end
up forming the dough.

## Ingredients

### For the Poolish

Makes 1.5 kg dough - 6 pizzas if each is 240 g, 7 at 214 g.  The pizzas are small-to-medium
in size.

- 450 g pizza flour
- 450 g water
- 0.9 g yeast (precision scales help a lot with this)

### For the Pizza

- 450 g Flour
- 150 g water
- 18-21 g salt
- Semolina (to dust and prevent sticking)


### For the Sauce

If you have a particular favourite sauce go nuts and use it instead!  Here's what I do use:

- 2 cans (375g each) whole peeled Italian tomatoes
- 3-4 cloves of garlic
- half a large onoin, chopped finely.
- small pinch of chilli flakes
- generic dried Italian herb blend
- salt, pepper and olive oil.

### Toppings

Dealers choice!  do whatever makes you happy but I recommend cheese!

## Method

The longest wait is for the poolish - it takes approximately 10-11 hours
before it's ready to use, and then the dough usually takes another 7-8 hours
to become ready for cooking.  The sauce can be made any time.  I'd suggest
making it ahead of time.

### Preparing the Sauce

1. Heat a stockpot over medium flame with a small amount of olive oil until hot enough to make the onion
sizzle.

2. Gently fry onions until translucent and brown.  Depending on the amount of oil used, the onions might
initially absorb the oil, and then return it to the pan some time later as they break down.

3. Towards the end of browning the onions also add finely chopped cloves of garlic to the pot.
Garlic will be ready when fragrant and softened.  If it's still got a harsh garlic flavour, keep simmering.

4. blend the peeled tomatoes, adding the garlic and onions to puree.  Add salt to taste

5. Simmer for 30 minutes to 1.5 hours, until desired consistency is met.  Season to taste. Towards the end of
cooking add Italian herb mix and a small amount of chilli.

6. Set aside for future use.  Works for Pizza when at room temperature.

It's up to you how thick you'd like your sauce to be.  We go for approximately halfway between the original blended
consistency and tomato paste - thick enough that it doesn't immediately return behind a spoon dragged through the pot.

### Preparing the Poolish

Combine Flour (450g), water (450g) and yeast (1g).  Then wait forever (usually ~10 hours).  The poolish will
smell slightly sweet, yeasty and have lots of bubbles when it's ready to go.

### Preparing the Dough

1. Add the poolish to a large mixing bowl along with 150g water.  using your fingers, stir in the poolish
with the water until the consistency is even.  It's usually obvious if this isn't complete, as the poolish
has a thicker consistency and tends to float on the surface of the water.

2. Once ready, add flour (450g) and salt (18-21g) over the top and mix by hand.  Mix until the flour until there are no more dry
pockets of flour, cover and let hydrate foir 15 minutes, then mix to combine fully.

3. (optional) After 30 minutes, try and build some strength in the dough, gently pick it up by its base from the mixing bowl and fold it
over itself to try and shape it into a ball.  Turn the dough 60 degrees and repeat 2-3 times.  Works best when you support half the dough
with your hand and let gravity do the work.  Should the dough become very stiff or you notice signs of any tearing on the dough surface, stop
immediately.

3. Let bulk ferment for 1-2 hours or until you're bored and remember you're making pizza.  Now it's time to divide the dough
into dough balls for their final rise.  Weigh and portion the dough balls, and form them into balls.  There are several ways
to do this but the way I find most effective is to cup my hands around the base furthest from me and pull gently.  The  natural
tendancy for the dough to stick to the surface will mean they tend to form balls without much effort.  Be gentle and repeat the process
turning the dough several times.

4. Let proof for ~7 hours.  Dough balls are ready when more than doubled in size and spring back a little, but not completely once poked.


### Forming and the Pizzas

Once the dough balls have proofed, and you've got an oven ready to go (as hot as you can get -- my best results were at 350C).
This is actually tricky -- read through some tutorials and make a plan.  Or dont - it's fun eitehr way.

1. cover the dough balls with Semolina.  This works best if you have a bowl full of it and dunk your balls
in it, covering both sides.  Similar to how you'd crumb a chicken breast.

2. Bring your fingertips together to form a line, but leave your index fingers out, otherwise it forms more of a W shape.
Starting from the centre of the dough balls, press your fingers down gently and then move them upwards towards the crust.  Stop
where you think a nice crust should start, rotate the ball clokcwise and repeat.  What you should be aiming to do here is
to squeeze air into what will become the crust, and make a thin base for your toppings of choice.

3. The dough will need to be stretched beyond this just a little bit.  This is where most of my mistakes happen, so you're on your own!
If you want a very enthusiastic description by a french guy check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbkHihvXCPg) where you'll
feel like you learn heaps but actually don't know what you're doing afterwards.  If you'd prefer a slightly more direct explanation with
less theatrics [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAwDlOxZbEc) is less entertaining but easier to follow.  If you'd like a hyperactive
Italian to explain it, then [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-jPoROGHGE) might be the one for you.

Anyway - try to stretch it without breaking it, dropping it, making it too thin or otherwise embarrassing yourself and shaming your ancestors
in front of your family and friends.

4. Giving it a little extra semolina to prevent sticking, transfer it to a pizza peel, build your pizza and put it in an oven that is as
hot as you can get it.  Regardless, a pizza stone is probably a good idea since it will allow the base to breathe, prevent sticking
and will radiate additional heat to help things along.  It's ready when it looks like Pizza.  If you're not sure, just try not to incinerate it
like I did my first pizza and adjust accordingly.

## Tips & Tricks

- Measuring dough temparature is a thing!  I've had poolishes that have been very unreliable - and would take _forever_ to be ready.
Once I started ensuring the initial mixed poolish temperature was between 21-24 degrees Celsius things improved.  I have an instant
laser thermometer (because lasers are cool) which I find helps.

- Pracise your pizza slapping technique on tea-towel or suffer the consequences.

- I don't tend to knead the dough much -- I find folding it a couple times is mostly OK for strength.  I hear lots of discussion about kneading
it and I don't understand why.  But then I struggle to shape mine consistently, so perhaps the two are connected.

- Semolina (_not_ Salmonella!) is the secret ingredient that makes it taste like _real_ pizza.  Plus it helps sticking.  win win!

- I only tend to get really nice leopard spotting with ovens that are 320 C and above (wood fired ovens help considerably)

- Room temperature sauces is best for the pizzas

- Some people dress the pizza base with a dash of olive oil.  I am not some people.

- If you're particularly talented and _forget_ to add the poolish to the dough mixture, then there is no hope of redemption.
Save yourself some time and embarrassment and start afresh tomorrow and order takeout.
