    OK, not super pretty, but proof I made them right?  These ended up a little too brown for me
    and yet 'just right' for my partner who advocated for a longer bake time.

I found a blog where the author has seemingly done a thesis on all things Scottish
shortbread at [Wayne Schmidt's Scottish Shortbread Page](http://waynesthisandthat.com/shortbread.htm).
The article discusses at great length the most ideal shortbread recipe, so I've stripped out the interesting
bits and just provided the instructions here for future reference.

I happened to find the page using this [weird search engine](https://search.marginalia.nu/about.html).
It's a really cool project and I promise you'll find interesting stuff if you make a couple searches
with it.  After all, I found this!

## Ingredients

- 1/3 cup granulated sugar (I used caster sugar)
- 1/8 teaspoon popcorn salt (very finely ground salt - I used a mortar and pestle)
- 1/2 (113g) cup softened salted butter
- 215g all purpose flour

## Method

1. Dump ingredients into a bowl and mix until everything is combined.  The mixture resembles sand and barely
holds together under pressure.

I used a stand mixer with paddle attachment, but if I didn't have one I'd probably use a set of electric beaters
to accomplish the same end.

2. find some kind of mold, dump the mixture into it and compact it, and throw it in the fridge for 1+ hours.  I don't have a great mould, but have instead used a muffin tray to mediocre effect, or, squished it between two
sheet pans and cut with a knife to poor effect.

3. in an oven at 150C bake for approximately half an hour.  excessive browning is a sign they're burning.

## Tips & Tricks

- If going the muffin tray route, don't grease the trays as somehow this causes it to stick more than if you
ignored it entirely.

- My partner always wants these to go in the oven for 5-10 minutes longer than I do so they get a light brown top.
I think this makes them taste like they're burnt but she quite likes them.
