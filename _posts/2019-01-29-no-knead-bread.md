## About
Possibly one of the easier things to make, this no knead bread for the most part only needs time to develop.
Only a very small amount of yeast is used, and as a result the bread takes 24 hours to rise.  Although
in doing so, the gluten fibres of the bread are formed and very gradually stretched which avoids the need to
knead the bread as in most breads.

A benefit of the long rise is the opportunity for lots of different flavours in the bread to develop.  I'm not going
to lie, I don't understand the process all that well - something about enzymes and such.

A couple notes.  I often find that after sitting for a day the initially shaggy dough becomes a little bit wet and difficult
to work with.  One solution is to gradually add flour when shaping the bread as it sticks to things to make it easier to work with.  I've found that wet dough is easier to work with wet hands, so you might also find that useful.

Occasionally I've tried folding in things like seeds.  They don't do so well with the 24 hour rise period, so I find it best to
add them when forming the loaf, as doing so requires working with the dough enough to fold in whatever thing you wanted to add.
I'm quite a fan of flax seeds, myself.

Credit to this goes to the New York Times recipe I encountered one fateful evening trying to impress Ivy with my awesome
bread-making skills.  'Cause, you-know that's what anybody looks for in a partner.  You can find it [from the equine's mouth](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11376-no-knead-bread "No-Knead Bread, NY Times.").  For completeness I have the recipe
below with our notes.  Time to rise varies somewhat; 20 Celsius is probably ideal and higher and lower temperatures reduce and
increase rise times respectively.

## Ingredients
- 3 cups plain flour
- 1 1/2 cups water
- 1/4 teaspoon dry yeast
- 1 1/4 teaspoon salt
- Bread improver, according to directions (optional - we usually don't use any and eat the loaf the same day)

## Method
1. Combine all the dry ingredients and mix so approximately evenly distributed
2. Mix in water and combine until left with a shaggy dough.
3. Cover with cling wrap, leave at room temperature approximately 24 hours.
4. An hour before baking take the dough out, stretch it into a thick sheet and then fold over itself to form a ball.  Doing so shapes the gluten into the shape of your loaf and provides structure.
5. Rest the dough for an hour while an oven preheats somewhere in the neighborhood of 240 degrees celsius.  (increasing or decreasing the temperature hardens / softens the crust)
6. Add dough to the oven on a tray.  If using baking paper, add the loaf last minute (things tend to stick otherwise)
7. Bake at 15 minutes at high temperature, reducing to 180 celsius for another 45 minutes.
8. Remove bread from oven and cool.  Bread will make a hollow sound if cooked (add extra time if unsure)
9. try not to eat the entire loaf straight away.

## Pizza base adaptation (Work in Progress)
I've got a good suggestion for a red sauce (pending), but if you wanted to turn this into a somewhat thick and bready pizza dough, prepare the dough as above, and add 1 tablespoon of oil.  I'm still figuring out the best way to manage this, as a problem you'll have is that the dough will lack strength, and will be difficult to stretch as a result.  When I've gotten a thin base, it's been too thin in some places, and too thick in others.
