## About
A recipe adapted from my favourite malaysian food blogger, [Bee](https://rasamalaysia.com/, "RASAMALAYSIA")
which can be found [here.](https://rasamalaysia.com/ayam-masak-merah-recipe/ "ayam-masak-merah-recipe")
Since we don't have a food processer, we use a blender instead but a food blender is ideal for making a fine sauce.

## Ingredients

- 10 pieces of chicken thigh/ drumstick with Skin on.  Maryland works well.

### Seasoning

- 2 tbs salt
- 2 tbs tumeric

### Sauce

- 20 dried chillies (soak for 1 hour)
- 2 red onion
- 5 cloves of garlic
- 40g ginger
- 30g galangal
- 3 lemongrass
- 2-3 star anise
- 4 clove
- 3 cardamom
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 1 can of tomato soup (400ml)
- 1 can of coconut milk (400ml)
- 1 cup of baby peas (optional)

## Instructions

1. Mix the seasoning ingredients in a large bowl, dry-rubbing onto the chicken pieces. Allow it to marinade for at least 2 hrs, preferably overnight. 
2. Shallow fry the chicken pieces in a pan. Transfer the Fried pieces into the slow cooker. 
3. Roughly chop onions, garlic, chilli, ginger, galangal and lemongrass before transfer into a blender. Blend into a smooth paste.
4. Heat up 1/3 cup of canola oil in a median sized sauce pan. Saute the whole spices until aromatic before adding the blended paste. Cook until oil separates from the paste, then transfer to the mixture into the slow cooker. Add tomato soup and coconut milk to slow cooker. Set slow cooker on high and cook for 4 hours (Add baby peas half an hour before it's done).
